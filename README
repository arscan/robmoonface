Just a simple Android live wallpaper for my Android that rotates a night sky in front of a silhouetted landscape.

Built for the learning experience, but may be useful for somebody interested in how some live wallpapers work (such as Nightfall Live Wallpaper, of which this live wallpaper is a clone: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.driftwood.wallpaper.nightfall.free).

Please excuse my face on the moon (from which the name of this wallpaper is derived) -- inside joke ;-)
